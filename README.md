Express-modular is basically a directory structure boilerplate. It can be used to quickly setup a modular directory strucutre without any hassle, thus, saving your quality time to focus on development.

express-modular relies on the principles of MVC architecture, so directories are named accordingly.

The directory structure is as follows:

|-app
|----controllers
|----helpers
|----middlewares
|----models
|----public
|--------css
|--------images
|--------js
|----tests
|----views
|
|-app.js
|
|-package.json
